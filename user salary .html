<!-- TASK #1: Take a salary from the user. 
    ✅️ If the salary is greater than 50,000, give them 2 allowances (like: health 12,000 & rent 2,000). 
    ✅️ Then, the salary you get will be the user's net salary and you will make it visible to them. 
    ✅️ If the user's salary is above 100,000, give them 4 allowances. 
    ✅️ If their salary is below 50,000, give them 1 allowance. 
    ✅️ If their salary is above 150,000, give them 6 allowances. 
    ✅️ And if their salary is 200,000 (= condition), cut their salary.-->
